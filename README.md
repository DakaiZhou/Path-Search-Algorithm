# coding_challenge_V2

Though the time is over,  after taking a break, I think it still worth to make a seperated better repo. In the first repo, I did not add any comments and exists small bugs. 
This repo I added some comments and fixed the bugs, now it is stable. There are total 5 places I changed after the deadline, and I made a change note near the changed code.
